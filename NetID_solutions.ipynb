    "\n",
    "Assumption: The assignment Zi is independent of potential recovery outcomes Yobs, conditional on observed covariates (if any).\n",

    "\n",
    "Assumption: There are no \"defiers\" in the population, meaning that no patient would choose physiotherapy if a discount is offered and refuse it if the standard cost is charged.\n",
    "Plausibility: Monotonicity is a challenging assumption to verify in practice. In healthcare, it's reasonable to assume that people who have the option of a discount will use it, rather than refusing treatment. However, it's not always easy to confirm this assumption.\n",
    "Common Support:\n",

The ITT effect reflects the broad policy impact, while the Local ATE offers a more tailored perspective for patients who actively opted for physiotherapy. Clinically, this indicates that some patients may be highly motivated to receive physiotherapy if costs are reduced, while others may not be as influenced by the discount.\n",

It suggests that offering discounts may attract patients who are highly motivated to undergo physiotherapy and potentially lead to increased healthcare utilization and costs.\n",
